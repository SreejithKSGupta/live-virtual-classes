            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Generative AI is a groundbreaking subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content. Unlike traditional AI, which is designed to recognize patterns and make decisions based on existing data, generative AI can produce original text, images, music, and more. This technology is revolutionizing various industries by enabling machines to generate creative and innovative outputs.</p>

            <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
            <p>Generative AI involves algorithms that can generate new data similar to the data they were trained on. These algorithms, often based on neural networks, learn the underlying patterns and structures of the input data and use this knowledge to create new, similar content. Popular models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).</p>

            <h2>History of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The concept of generative AI has been around for decades, but significant advancements have been made in recent years. The introduction of GANs by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014 marked a major milestone. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together to create realistic data. This innovation has led to rapid progress in the field.</p>
